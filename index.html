          <h2>What is Roquefort?</h2>
          <p>
            Roquefort is a famous blue-veined cheese made with unpasteurised
            ewe's milk and produced in the Aveyron department in southern
            France.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you may have guessed, it's my favourite cheese! I've even been to
            the caves at Roquefort Société for a guided tour. Bewilderingly,
            it’s only the second most popular cheese in France – the first being
            Comté!
          </p>
          <p>
            This cheese is creamy white in colour with distinctive veins of
            green mould. It’s crumbly and moist and has no rind. The exterior is
            edible. A typical wheel of Roquefort weighs between 2.5 and 3kg and
            measures approximately 10cm in diameter. It’s rich in fat, protein
            and minerals such as calcium. It has a strong, salty flavour. Dry
            red wine is considered an ideal accompaniment.
          </p>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Roquefort is one of the oldest cheeses still in production and was
            said to be the favourite cheese of Charlemagne. In France, it is
            affectionately known as “the cheese of kings and popes”. In 79AD,
            Pliny the Elder commented on its rich flavour.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the legend, a young shepherd on the Combalou plateau
            saw a beautiful woman in the distance. Enamoured, he abandoned his
            meal of bread and ewe’s cheese in a nearby cave and pursued her.
            Several days later, he returned to find his food had gone mouldy.
            Starving, he hesitantly sampled the cheese. “Mais c’est bon!” he
            cried and Roquefort was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            A very romantic tale but if you believe that, you'll believe
            anything! Now for some real history:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1411</strong> – King Charles VI liked the cheese so much
              that he gave the village of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon a monopoly for
              maturing the cheese in the local caves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1925</strong> – Roquefort was the first recipient of the
              Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1961</strong> – the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Millau
              decreed that only cheese matured in the natural cellars of
              Roquefort-sur-Soulzon is allowed to carry the name of “Roquefort”
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Present day</strong> – Roquefort has European recognition
              with the Appellation d'Origine Protégée (AOP).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Production</h2>
          <p>
            The mould that gives Roquefort its distinctive character is
            <em>Penicillium roqueforti</em>. It is found in the soil of the
            local caves. Traditionally, the mould was produced by leaving bread
            in the caves for six to eight weeks. The bread was then dried to
            produce a powder. These days, the mould is predominantly cultured in
            labs for improved uniformity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Roquefort is made exclusively from the milk of the red Lacaune
            sheep, which graze throughout the department of Aveyron and in part
            within the neighbouring departments of Aude, Lozère, Gard, Hérault
            and Tarn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around 4.5 litres of milk are needed to produce 1kg of Roquefort.
            It’s matured in the caves for four to nine months. The maturation is
            strictly confined to the village of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon.
          </p>
          <p>Presently, there are seven producers of Roquefort cheese:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Roquefort Société</li>
            <li>Roquefort Papillon</li>
            <li>Gabriel Coulet</li>
            <li>Carles</li>
            <li>Fromageries Occitanes</li>
            <li>Verrières</li>
            <li>Combes (Le Vieux Berger)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Roquefort Société is by far the largest, owning several caves and
            representing around 60% of production. Their facilities are open to
            the public via scheduled guided tours.
          </p>
          <p>
            I highly recommend a visit if you're ever in that region of France
            and looking for something to do. Be warned though, if you stop for
            food in the village, virtually every dish is liberally drenched in
            Roquefort cheese.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I originally wrote this text in French
            and translated it back to English for this webpage! It was for a
            presentation I gave at an evening class. J'adore le Roquefort!
